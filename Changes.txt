   directories, and files.

   directive.

   to be specified.

Version 1.2
-----------
New Features:

   new option 'htmltext-ignorenewlines'
 - htmltext-ignorenewlines option added to disable the addition of '<br>'
    elements for each newline in the content.
   
Bug fixes:
 - Renamed the Catalogue property 'items' to 'entries' to avoid the conflict with the
   dictionary method of the same name.

  
Version 1.1

    photos).
