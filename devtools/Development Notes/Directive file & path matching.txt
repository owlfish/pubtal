<Content filetype: *.sxw directory: weblog>
</Content>

<Content weblog/*.sxw>
</Content>

Layout:
	one.txt
	two.txt
	adir/one.txt
	adir/two.txt
	adir/three.txt
	
<Content three.txt>
</Content>

Should this match nothing (no such file!) or adir/three.txt?

What about:
<Content two.txt>
</Content>

Does this just apply to two.txt or does it also apply to adir/two.txt?

Need a default, and a way of over-riding the default.
e.g.
	<Content file: two.txt>
	</Content>
	
	Order of parsing would be:
		Look for 'file:' 
		Look for 'directory:'
		Look for 'pattern:'
		
		Example of a file match:
			weblog/this/that/afile.txt
		Can also act as a fnmatch - look for afile.txt in only the weblog/this/that/
		
		
	Alternative:
	<Content pattern: two.txt>
	</Content>
	
	
Alternative - match paths not filenames.

Example:
	<Content two.txt> - just match the two.txt file.
	<Content */two.txt> - match all two.txt files.
	<Content *.sxw> - match all sxw files.
	<Content weblog/*.sxw> - match all sxw files in weblog directory or deeper
	
	Longer match would take precidence.
	
	
Conclusion:
	Parsing logic should be:
		If file exists - is a file.
		If directory exists - is a directory.
		Else:
			Is a pattern.  
			Priority:
				Deepest directory has higest priority.
				
	Mixture of directory and pattern:
		<Content weblog/*.txt>
		should take priority over <Content weblog>
		
					
Limitations:
	If a file exists with the same name as a pattern that is being matched then the pattern will not take.
	
Implementation:
	Change fileTypeMap to patternMap
	Each key will be a directory, with an empty value for root level file types.
	The value is a list of tuples (fnmatch expressions, config item)
	
	While looping over directories check for patternMap entries.
	For each entry in the patternMap check for matches.
	
Issues:
	We would like <Content> to take precidence over *.txt
	<Content weblog/*.txt> should overridge <Content weblog>
	
	Could we have:
		<Content *.txt> override <Content>
		<Content weblog/*.txt> override <Content weblog>
		
	or:
		<Content> overrides <Content *.txt>
		<Content weblog> overrides <Content weblog/*.txt>
