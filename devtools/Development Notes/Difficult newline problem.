<i>Starting with a tag.</i>

The final problem is <b>about to happen.</b>
<pre><code>The final tag issue.</code></pre>

<h2>Do we really want a br?</h2>
I would say not for this case.

<h3>What about here?</h3>

<b>Harder</b> case.  Answer: No - paragraph!

<h3>Easy</h3>
<ul>
	<li>One</li>
</ul>

<h3>Also easy</h3>
Some text.
<ul>
	<li>One</li>
</ul>

<b>Easiest case?</b>
<i>Perhaps.</i>

<i>Empty tags shouldn't count!</i>

Logic: If the current paragraph has content (other than <p> tag) then the *first* newline, even if empty, should have a newline printed out.

Three situations when closing a paragraph:
	Closing because of a new paragraph opening.
	Closing because of a new block level element opening (could be a paragraph).
	
e.g.:
	Paragarph 1: Hello
	
	Paragraph 2: There.
	
	Parargraph 1: New block
	<h1>Header</h1>
	
Result: We *never* want a newline <br> at the close of a paragraph.

We call closeParagraph:
	When we have split text into two paragraphs in handleAccumulatedData()
	When we are starting a new block level element (in startElement())
	When we have finished processing everything.
	
Suggestion:
	If we are about to close a paragraph then *don't* *ever* write out a newline.
	Issue: We write out newlines when we see a NL char, *before* we know that this is the last paragraph.
