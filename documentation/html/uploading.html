<h1>Uploading</h1>
  <p id="subject">Automatic uploading using PubTal.</p>
  <div><p>PubTal can automatically upload a website to an FTP server.&nbsp; To enable this feature, one or more &lt;Upload&gt; directives must be added to the site's <a href="conf/conf.html">configuration file</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To determine what files require uploading, PubTal uses the following technique:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When PubTal writes a file, it records a checksum for the file (stored in the PubTalData/localCache file by default).</li>
	<li>When PubTal uploads a file, it records the checksum of the file it uploaded (stored in a server-specific file in PubTalData/).</li>
	<li>When asked to upload a site, PubTal compares the two checksum files.&nbsp; If there is a new file, or different checksum for an existing file in the localCache, then it will upload the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally PubTal will not upload files that it didn't generate, however this can be overridden by passing the --all command option to uploadSite.py.&nbsp; This causes uploadSite.py to checksum all files that PubTal didn't generate, and again compare them to the upload checksum file.</p>
<p>PubTal can be forced to upload files that it thinks haven't changed by using the --force command option.&nbsp; Similarly PubTal can mark files as being up-to-date by using the --uptodate command option.</p>
<p>A full list of the different command options available are given in the <a href="command.html">Commands Reference</a>.</p>
