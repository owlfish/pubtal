title: Example Home Page

This is an example home page.  To rebuild these pages after editing the configuration file, content, or the template simply run the command <code>updateSite.py examples/homepage/site.config</code>.

To demonstrate how easy it is to manage navigation across multiple pages I've also included a <a href="second/index.html">second page</a> in this example.
