title: Example of Raw Content
description: Demonstrates Raw HTML/XHTML pass through.

<p>In this example the content consists of headers followed by Raw HTML/XHTML.  By using the 'Raw' content-type PubTal will parse and use the headers in the file, and treat the rest of the content as pre-formated HTML or XHTML.</p>

<p>This allows arbitrary chunks of markup to be included into a site, and is useful for those who are happiest coding in HTML.</p>
